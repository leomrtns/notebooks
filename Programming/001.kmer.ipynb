    "# 001 K-mer in biomcmc-lib (2019.11.29)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a few details of how kmers are implemented in the low-level phylogenetic library [biomcmc-lib](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/biomcmc-lib). \n",
    "This library is opaque to the user, and contains functions that are common to several projects. \n",
    "The functions discussed here relate to the creation of the k-mers (and their hash values) for a given DNA sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please have in mind that these functions are likely to change or at least change names soon &mdash; they are general enough to have allowed me to play with kmers, but are too complex for production-level software. \n",
    "Two missing functionalities are:\n",
    "1. inexact (masked) k-mers. \n",
    "2. rolling hashes\n",
    "3. using 32 bits per hash value (64 bits may be overkill)\n",
    "4. homopolymer compression\n",
    "5. fine-grained control over k-mer sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Some code shown here depends on local libraries, which must be linked at compilation time (`//%cflags:-lm` etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Parameters of a kmer set\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it may be onerous to scan through the DNA sequence several times, I decided to generate kmers for several choices of `k` in one pass. \n",
    "The library uses 128 bits to store each kmer, and immediately transforms it into its 64 bits hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore there are 3 possible encodings for each base: 1, 2, and 4 bits per base.\n",
    "The standard used by most kmer algorithms is equivalent to 2 bits per base (`A->00`, `C->01`, `G->10`, `T->11`).\n",
    "The other two are a compact, GC-content-like one bit per base(`A,T->0`, and `C,G->1`), and one common in the phylogenetic likelihood structure, that can accommodate ambiguous characters. \n",
    "For instance, since `M` represents an amino group (`C` or `A`), then we can have `A->0001`, `C->0010`, `M->0011`, and `N->1111`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is implemented in biomcmc-lib (2019.11.29), and is responsible for selecting the sets of k-mer sizes depending on an integer `mode` given by the user. \n",
    "This code is subject to change.\n",
